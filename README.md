# Night-Sky

Hi baby,

  I made this project with the idea of how much I love you. I am constantly trying to find ways to your heart and this is just my latest path. I couldn't control myself because I was also proud of my work so I ended up showing you instead of keeping it a surprise smh.

  This was my hardest project yet and the idea I've completing this for you kept me pushing. Just like in real life you always push me to be my best self.

  I used to stare at the sky by myself but now I am glad you are looking up with me.

  I love you babe to the moon and back and more than all the stars in the universe.

  Never let go of me

  Love Always, BT <3
